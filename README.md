# Fundamental

## Investment Philosophy

Fundamental takes the [Eventide Asset Management approach](https://www.eventideinvestments.com/investment-approach) to establishing an investable universe and evaluating companies. 

The approach can be understood as a branching tree, where towards the core (or the "trunk") we have more philosophical components, and as we branch, the components become more practical and objective (e.g. "positive free cash flow" etc). At the heart of the philosophy, we maintain that we are doing "Investing that makes the world _rejoice_ ®".

### 1. Long-Term Competitive Advantage
The whole of the analysis is focused on determining A) **a company's long-term competitive advantage** and B) **its impact on human flourishing.** Both of these aspects have varying degrees of quantitative and qualitative considerations within them.

#### A. Financial Analysis
Long-term competitive advantage is assessed using **Financial Analysis** and by investigating more **Qualitative Traits**.

##### Three Legs of the Stool
1. **Sentiment**
   - Social sentiment
   - 13F filings: hedgefunds and super-investors often invest contrary to social sentiment

2. **Leading Indicators**
   - Macroeconomic headwinds
   - Macroeconomic tailwinds

3. **Valuation**
   - Attractive Income Generation
   - Consistent and Repeatable Revenue and Earnings Growth
   - Stable Business Model
   - Stable or Increasing Operating Margins
   - Strong Balance Sheet
   - Positive Free Cash Flow

   *Reinforced by Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to determine intrinsic value*

#### B. Qualitative Traits
1. **Sustainable Competitive Advantage**
2. **Attractive Industry**
   - Secular growth trends
3. **Great Management Teams**
4. **Creation of Compelling Value**

### 2. Impact on Human Flourishing
The Impact on Human Flourishing is assessed as an analysis of **what a company makes** and **how they make it**. We can frame these two ideas as an examination of **Good Products** and **Good Practices**.

#### A. Good Products
Products and services that:

   - [ ] Products protect the world (1-5)

3. **Restore** Creation

   - [ ] Products heal brokenness (1-5)

#### B. Good Practices
Good Practices can be defined as service to **customers**, **employees**, **suppliers**, **communities**, **the environment**, and **society**:
1. **Customers**
   - Are customers being served well?
2. **Employees**
   - Do employees have good jobs?
3. **Suppliers**
   - Are suppliers valued as strategic partners?
4. **Host Communities**
   - Are communities better off for the company's presence?
5. **Environment**
   - Is the environment being cared for and protected?
6. **Society at Large**
   - Is the world made better for this company's existence?

## Core Belief

Critically, we believe that businesses that **create value** for society are best positioned for long-term outperformance. We want to partner with companies who are creating **compelling value** for the **global common good**.
